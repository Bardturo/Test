I have included different coding samples written in R using Rstudio Markdown. Unfortunately, I cannot include the data used for each sample.

# Child

Bardales_SampleTask_Child.Rmd explores simulated data of a particular childcare center's work shifts and child visits. I explore the importance of certain weekdays in late parent pick-ups, the average childcare burden for different caregivers on their shifts, and the ways the simulated data reflects or deviates from real data. Each row in the data represents a child's stay at the center, including information on their caregiver, their check-in and pick-up times, and their caregiver's shift times. I perform various transformations on the data to obtain information on the childcare burden on a given day. I visualize these trends in graphs and tables throughout.

# Mobility

Bardales_SampleTask_Mobility.Rmd investigates the determinants of mobility and earnings inequality in the U.S. using real but cleaned data. There are three sections on different but semi-related topics: (1) employment disparity during COVID-19, (2) racial disparities in future earnings among lower-income children, (3) the relationship between college characteristics and mobility. Most of the data transformations involve date variables, calculation of particular summary statistics, and merging. I visualize the data in graphs and plots throughout. In section 2, I manually calculated binned averages to generate a binned scatterplot of earnings disparity. In section 3, I estimate two linear regression models and report their coefficients and relevant statistics.
